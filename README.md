# [Build a Markdown Previewer](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)
## [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Front End Libraries Projects

## Objective
Build a markdown previewer app that is functionally similar to the [example app](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO).

The [completed app](https://elrolfe-fcc-frontend.gitlab.io/markdown) was coded with React.

## User Stories
The markdown previewer app fulfills the following user stories provided by FreeCodeCamp.org:
1. I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
2. I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type
5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements:
    - A header (H1 size)
    - A sub header (H2 size)
    - A link
    - Inline code
    - A code block
    - A list item
    - A Blockquote
    - An image
    - Bolded text
6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
7. **(Optional Bonus)** When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab.
8. **(Optional Bonus)** My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as `br` (line break) elements.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
